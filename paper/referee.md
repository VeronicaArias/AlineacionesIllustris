The article „We are not the 99 per cent: quantifying asphericity in the distribution of Local Group satellites“ by J. Forero-Romero and V. Arias
studies the satellite population of a large scale cosmological simulation (Illustris, the dark matter only version and its hydro counterpart) and a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations (ELVIS) of Local Group analogues. The aim of the paper is to build a probability distribution for the asphericity of satellite galaxies around Local Group (LG) like systems based on cosmological simulations. The result is used to quantify the atypicality of the LG in the framework of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmology. The results presented here suggest that the LG lies within the 3 sigma tail of the LCDM distribution in terms of satellite asphericity. However, a strong influence of dark matter halo mass and baryonic effects is found. The results of this paper are interesting and timely. Nevertheless, the article suffers from inconsistencies, a large number of spelling errors (even in the abstract) and sometimes an unclear presentation of results. The large number of spelling errors and inconsistencies of e.g. quoted values in the text and in the figures clearly shows that the authors did not spend much time on proof reading the manuscript which left a negative impression on me. I advice for future submissions to proof read the manuscript carefully before submitting in order to leave a more positive impression appropriate for the interesting results reported. Therefore I recommend major revision of this article before I can consider it for publication in MNRAS.


Major comments:

* section 2.2, page 4 and section 2.3, page 4, end of first column:
The authors say Appendix A shows physical properties like e.g. stellar masses of the halo pairs. I can't find any stellar mass plots or listings. Furthermore, ELVIS is a DMO simulation suite so the only simulation with stellar masses is Illustris. Please, add the stellar mass information for solely Illustris or be consistent throughout the paper and remove the reference to stellar masses.

* section 3.1:
The authors select 11 up to 15 satellites. While for MW 11 satellites corresponds to the "classical MW satellites" nowadays we know many more satellites (>30). The number of 15 corresponds to "the minimum number of M31 satellites usually included in M31 studies". While this might be true for the nuber of plane members of studies of the plane of satellites around M31 by e.g. Ibata+2013 these authors indeed used ALL the satellites found in the Pandas footprint. However, there are many more staellites known around M31 and the 15 in the plane are not necessarily the most massive/luminous ones. Thus, it would be far more informative to calculate the asphericity of MW and M31 satellites for the classical/conventional number of satellites (11 or 15) and the whole (known) satellite population to see if asphericity is the result of low number statistics or if there is indeed a depepndence on satellite mass. E.g. are the most massive satellites preferentially distributed in a planar fashion?

* section 3.3:
The authors randomize the position of satellites while keeping their radial distribution fixed to compare satellite distribution against their own randomized distribution. Different halo pairs have different masses. How do the authors account for the fact, that a more massive halo has on average a 'wider' satellite distribution with on average larger radii for the satellites? Would the results change if a rescaling, like e.g. rescaling/normalizing all satellite radii by R200 of the host would be done? Could this take out the halo mass dependence?

* section 4.4 and 5, end of third paragraph:
The authors say the results of the multivariate gaussian fitting are robust agianst changes in the simulation. However, as Figure 5 clearly shows there are large differences in the number of LG-like systems in the simulations (e.g. M31: 2700 Illustris, 5688 Illustris dark and 3700 ELVIS). Furthermore comparing the corner plots (Fig. 4, C2, C4) for the different simulations one can clearly identify major differences among the simulation setups. Correlations in the plane parameters are much weaker in the HYDRO case and for the b/a vs. c/a case correlations even change from slightly correlated to anti-correlated. This can be discussed in detail at the end of section 4.4 and 4.5 where already an attempt of discussion was made which can clearly be expanded.
Also the DMO simulations Illustris-dark and ELVIS show vastly different correlations (e.g. b/a vs. w or b/a vs c/a). Elaborating on these differences and working out/understanding where they are coming from is needed. In the case of Illustris-dark vs. Illustris-hydro cosmological parameters, simulation code setup, etc. are the same so its solely hydro effects which might vastly alter the correlations and their strength. However, the differences between Illustris-dark and ELVIS must be of different nature. Undertsanding and quantifying these effects is needed to interpret results obtained from DMO simulations in order to compare them with observations. An attempt is made in section 4.5 where median halo masses are compared. This could be expanded a bit.
In the case of Illustris vs. ELVIS the reason might lie in resolution (simulation code, difference of WMAP 9 vs WMAP 7) or selection effects introduced in the selection of ELVIS haloes. Here it would be greatly appreciable if the vastly different correlations for e.g. b/a vs. w could be discussed and investigated.

* section 4.5, line 59:
Here and in the abstract it says at most 2% of the pairs have asphericity comparable to the LG. This doesn't match the values stated in Figure caption 5 which says that only 1% of the LG analogues have properties similar to what is observed. Please clarify how the probability is derived and make sure the paper is coherent and not contradicting itself.



Moderate comments:

* section 3.1:
The authors select satellites in the simulation ranked by maximum circular velocity while in observations the satellites are selected by luminosity. Could they please elaborate a bit on why this selection results in a fair comparison or at least state some references. Which assumptions go into this?

* section 4, second paragraph, disussion Table 3,4:
".. confirms ... more spherical distribution for the M31." How does this go togehter with the claim that there is a plane of satellites around M31? How exactly are the 15 satellites for the M31 case choosen? The ones in the plane or the 15 most massive/luminous? If the 15 most massive/luminous are chosen, this explains why M31 is not planar. The satellites in the plane of M31 are not the most massive ones. This shows how important it is to clearly state the selection procedure of satellites and that a general characterization of asphericity (including all known satellites) is more informative.

* Figure 1, 2, 3:
(a) What exactly do the 5 stars show? Satellite numbers from 11 to 15? If so, please state that clearly. It is not obvious.
(b) While it is a nice idea to show MW and M31 on x and y axis, it is not at all clear why this is informative. It implies a correlation/dependence between, e.g. the plane width of MW and M31. Furthermore, as the ELVIS paper (Garirison-Kimmel+2014) states, there are no differences in satellite abundances and kinematics between paired and isolated haloes. Naively, from this one would expect that the width of planes in paired haloes should be independend. So, could the authors please spend some words on explaining the choice of visualization? I understand that this is a compact way of showing the results but a bit more discussion helps the reader to understand the authors's point.

* Figure 4 and Figure C2, C4:
Axis limits are different for all corner plots. This makes a direct comparison difficult. I would advice to make the axis limits the same for all plots (or otherwise remind the reader to pay attention to this).

* section 5, last two paragraphs:
If true, this result is very nice and fits the other hints that MW might be special. But then the question is, do any of the particularities stated here correlate with asphericity? How do these findings influence the probability of finding aspherical satellite distributions?

* section 4.5, last paragraph:
values for plane width and c/a ratios do not match the values in the corner plots. Please be consistent!!!

* Figure A.1:
The quality of the plots would highly be improved if the authors would add lines for the observed/estimated values and their uncertainties for the MW and M31.



Minor comments:

* Abstract:
The authors say "not enough systems fully resembling the LG". Could you in the main text explain what you exactly mean by this? Number of satellites? Radial distribution of satellites? Galaxy pairs? Any clue why this is the case?

* introduction, third paragraph:
observational studies have found... There is another study by Collins+2015 finding no difference between satellites in plane and off plane for M31 satellites.

* section 1, line 36:
What exactly do the authors mean by "explicit probability distribution"? Can this term be elaborated in the main text?

* section 2, second paragraph:
Why are only the brightest 11 to 15 satellites used? And what does 11 to 15 mean? 11 satellites for MW and 15 for M31 or is the whole range from 11 to 15 been used for both galaxies (in observations and simulations)?

* section 2.2, second paragraph:
baryonic mass resolution of Illustris is 1.2e6 Msun not! 8.0e7!!!

* section 2.2, selection of LG counterparts:
The authors discard haloes with a number of satellites smaller than 15, which are the lowest mass haloes. Do the authors have any intuition how this might affect the results of the study? The authors say already in the abstract, there is a dependence on halo mass but is there any trends already seen which might hint at the effect of discarding lower mass LG analogues?

* Table 3:
How exactly are the normalized values calculated. If I follow the description in the text I get the following result for e.g. M31:
(59-65)/12=-0.5 not -0.48 as the table says. Is the error on the normalized value just the standard error propagation or how is this calculated?

* Table 4:
It would be good if normalized results for the simulation (e.g. from the corner plots Fig.4, C2, C4) appear as well in the table.

* section 4.1, last two sentences:
missing word, general confusing, what do you want to say with these two sentences?

* section 4.1:
Can the fact that MW (as the lower mass halo of the two in the pair) has a thinner plane be explained by a halo mass dependence? (see also point above of rescaling by R200)

* section 4.2, last sentence:
close to between two and three... Is it close to or between? Please rewrite.

* section 4.5, first paragraph:
When drawing samples from the multivariate gaussians you assume halo pairs can be drawn independently? Is this assumption valid? Do you find any dependence of the results on the companion, its mass, distance, relative velocity, etc.? E.g. does a more massive M31 result in a thinner plane? Please discuss a bit more the procedure and assumptions.

* section 4.5, second last paragraph:
median halo masses are stated for the simulated analogues. Can the authors compare to observed/estimated values for MW and M31. It looks like the MW and M31 analogues are on the very lower end of estimated values for the LG (~220 km/s for MW and ~260 km/s for M31 e.g. Sofue+2016).

* section 4.5, last paragraph:
haloes get more spherical when baryonic effects are included, this was already found before (e.g. Bryan+2012).
