%Following a bit on the claim by Sawala that barionic physics are important when looking for planes, WE look in Illustris and Elvis simulations to try and understand why barionic physics results in planar distribution of satellites.

%\subsection{Evidencias observacionales de planos:}
\noindent Since the early works of (el que libeskind dice que habló de
eso primero) and Lynden-Bell (1976), the observed anisotropic
distribution of satellite galaxies in the Local Group has been a key
point in the discussion of galaxy formation models within $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. These pioneer papers described that the then known satellite
galaxies of the Milky May (MW) were distributed roughly following the plane
that contained the Magelanic clouds and their stellar tails. This
anisotropic distribution was further studied in the work of Pawlowski
et. al. (2012), where they included all the known MW satellite galaxies (XXX
more than in the original Lynden-Bell paper) as well as some MW globular
clusters, and found that they are all contained in what they call a
"Vast Plane Of Satellites" (VPOS). This structure is around 30kpc thick and
is perpendicular to the stellar disc of the MW galaxy. This plane of
satellites was considered a rarity until the PAndAS survey of the
Andromeda (M31) galaxy and its halo (missing reference on the survey)
provided a complete sample of the satellite galaxy population (above a
XXXX magnitude) of our neighboring galaxy, allowing their consistent distance
estimations (Conn et al. 2012). In a groundbreaking work, Ibata et
al. (2013) found that 15 out of the 30 satellites are in a planar
structure that is 15kpc thick and has an extension of 400kpc.
Additionally, from line of sight velocity measurements, they
found that the structure has an apparent coherent rotation, with the
satellites south of M31 moving away from us and those north of M31
coming towards us. This apparent organized rotation of satellite galaxies was also
statistically found to occur in diametrically opposed 
pairs of satellites from the SDSS (Ibata et al. 2014), although this
results were contested in a follow up paper by Cuatun et al. (2014).  

These discoveries of the planes in M31 and the MW were followed by the
remark from Shaya et al. (2013) that the other satellite galaxies in
M31 could be part of a second plane, further reinforcing the idea that
satellites in the local group are not isotropically distributed.
Despite the challenges in estimating distances to the satellites
galaxies, Tully et al. managed to go beyond the local group and found
two planes of satellites galaxies in Centaurus A, making a clearer
case for the planes of satellites: in all the galaxies where distance
measurements could be performed evidence of satellite planar
structures have been found.\\

These observed planes present a challenge for current galaxy formation
models (Pawlowski et al. 2014)

\section{Illustris simulation}

\section{Sample Selection}

We select all halos with maximum circular velocities in the
range 150 km s$^{-1}$ $<V_{\rm max}<$ 350 km s$^{1}$.
We exclude sub-halos from this selection.
From this set we construct a sample of pairs as follows.
For each halo $A$ we find its closest halo $B$, if halo $A$ is also
the closest to halo $B$, the two halos are considered as a pair. 
Another way to phrase this selection is that pairs do not have
neighbors closer than the pair's distance.
We exclude the pairs that are closer than
There are $53$ pairs with those conditions in the simulation.

We extract from the simulation spheres of $2$ \hMpc in radius around
the pair's center of mass. 
We use this information to exclude all the pairs that have separations
smaller than the sum  of their virial radii, i.e. we exclude
interacting pairs. 
This reduces to $49$ the number of pairs in the sample.

We count the number of galaxies with $M_V<-9$ inside the virial
radius of each halo, including the central galaxy.
We only keep pairs where both halos have 5 bright galaxies at least. 
This reduces the sample to $24$ pairs. 
We call this sample the Full  Sample.

From the Full Sample we build a second sample based on the pairs' kinematics. 
Figure \ref{fig:samples} shows the co-moving separation and relative
speed between the two halos in the pair.
The stars in the Figure represent the pairs with a separation in the
range $0.75\hMpc <R_{AB}< 1.50\hMpc$ and relative velocity in the
range $V_{AB}>100$ km s$^{-1}$, which are close to the Local Group
Observed values.
We call this sample the LG Sample.

The number of pairs in the Full Sample is consistent with previous
calculations. 
\cite{ForeroRomero2013} performed a study of the LG kinematics using a
cosmological N-body simulation as a benchmark. 
In their study, using criteria similar to ours to define the Full
Sample, they found 1923 pairs in a volume of $250^3$ $h^{-3}$
Mpc$^{3}$. 
With the same number density we expect to find $52$ pairs in the
volume of the Illustris simulation, which is very close to the actual
number of $49$ pairs.

In the same study they found 158 pairs with broad kinematic
characteristics, similar to the definition of our LG sample. 
This represents a reduction of a factor of $12$ from their General
Sample. 
With those numbers in mind we would expect to keep at least $4$ pairs
in the Illustris volume. 
Given that our conditions are slightly more relaxed (we do not ask for
isolation criteria from massive halos) we end up with a larger sample
size, but still consistent with the fact that LG-like pairs are
scarce.  

\citep{2011MNRAS.411.1525L} Measure the infall direction of satellites
in a DM only simulation of one pair of LG halos in a constrained
simulation. There is a definite infall direction but it's not
quantified in terms of the cosmic web.
 
\citep{2014MNRAS.443.1274L} Measure the infall direction of satellites
with respect to the V-web. They do it in a DM cosmological simulation
(64 Mpch, 1024 3 particles). They find that infall is done along the
e3 (i.e. filament) direction.

\citep{2015MNRAS.450.2727T} They measure the angle between satellites
and the direction defined by filaments (Bissous filament finder )to
find a signal both in SDSS and the semi-analytic galaxies in the
Millennium Simulation.

the direction defined by filaments (velocity shear cosmic web) on the
